  text: "PDF Page 8/9: Landing in Honduras you begin your search for Dancer. Spotting
    a local shop you approach the attendant to ask if they have heard of anything
    out of the ordinary happening. As luck would have it, the shop assistant had
    just served someone who was delighted in telling of their recent trip to the
    Cop\xE1n Ruins, where they had seen the most curious of creatures trapped in
    one of the ancient temples making a terrible racket to get out. They had relayed
    that people were trying to help the poor beast however without an ancient key
    to open the temple door there was no way to help it escape. With that knowledge
    in hand you head to the ruins and begin your search for the missing key! "
