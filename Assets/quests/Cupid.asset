  text: "PDF Page: 10.You arrive in Cape Town and get to your hotel. After grabbing
    a quick bite to eat you check the Santa-Nav but it seems to have gone on the
    fritz! Tracking Cupid down is going to be tough! To help you with your hunt you
    seek out the local elves for assistance. \u201CThey might have seen the Naughty
    elves or Cupid and could lend a hand\u201D. Starting at your hotel you find Bazar,
    who has been spreading Christmas cheer with his Festive Joy Blaster. As luck
    would have it, he saw the naughty elves gallivanting through the streets.  Use
    Google Maps to start your search to find out the name of the street, where you
    will discover Cupid."
