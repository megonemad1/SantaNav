  text: "The Santa Nav leads  you to the depths of Styx State Forest in Tasmania,
    who knows what the naughty elves were doing this deep in the wilderness. Following
    the trail, you find Donner collapsed on the side of the path crying out in pain.
    Looking Donner over you see that there is a nasty bite on his leg! Getting closer
    to inspect the wound, you see movement out the corner of your eye. It\u2019s
    a Snake! Realising what has happened you know time is of the essence when it
    comes to snake bites. You quickly tie one of your shoelaces above the wound to
    slow down the venom's effect. \u201CAt least I\u2019m here to help and you're
    not in that scene from your favourite film, crashing about blind locked in a
    trailer with a deadly snake stuck in the middle of the desert \u201D you say
    jokingly to try and lighten the severity of the situation. Grabbing Donner's
    shoulders, you pull him to his three good feet and help him limp to a clearing
    for the medivac you have called. The air ambulance arrives but with only the
    pilot in attendance you need to administer the antivenom on the flight to the
    hospital.  Use the medicine bottle to fill up your syringes with the antidote,
    the sink can be used to poor unwanted medicine away. Once you have the right
    dosage you will have healed Donner! "
