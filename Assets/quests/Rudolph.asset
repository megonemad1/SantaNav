  text: "PDF Page: 3. The Naughty elves have really gone and surpassed themselves
    this time! They have not only abandoned poor Rudolph in North Korea, but they
    have left him standing on a Landmine\u2026eek! Of course your bomb disposal knowledge
    is limited, so it is very lucky that the elves managed to swipe the defusal instructions
    from a passing soldier before they deserted Rudolph to his fate. You can see
    that you need to enter a cancellation code but unfortunately the instructions
    are in Korean. As you approach Rudolph you hear him singing \u201CI will Survive\u201D
    his number one song of choice. Reassuring Rudolf, you get to work at decoding
    the instructions and saving Rudolph from the horror that could await!"
