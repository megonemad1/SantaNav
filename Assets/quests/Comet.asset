  text: 'The Santa-Nav has led you to a remote part of Russia, you start to get a
    sinking feeling that this reindeer retrieval will not be straightforward at all.
    The longer you follow the directions the clearer it becomes; your destination
    is the Kursk Nuclear Plant! The armed guards on the gate were certainly friendlier
    than you imagined and directed you through to the control centre, it is there
    that you see Comet, and the predicament he is in! The reindeer is stuck inside
    the reactor room and can only be let out once all protocols have been followed. 
    In order to free Comet, someone needs to enter the same commands in the control
    centre as the reactor room. It is extremely dangerous and could potentially cause
    a nuclear meltdown if done incorrectly. looking around the room you see that
    all the Russian workers have made a hasty retreat, leaving Comets only chance
    for escape in your hands! Follow the control patten that will come through on
    your controller, once you have completed each of the sequences you will get the
    code to release comet. '
