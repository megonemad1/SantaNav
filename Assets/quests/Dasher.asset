  text: "After quite a bumpy reindeer ride, you arrive in Alaska only to find that
    Dasher has been locked up by a shopkeeper for aiding and abetting a group of
    young delinquents (the naughty elves at work again!) The shop keeper will let
    Dasher go without pressing charges as she only brought the group to his shop,
    but only if all the damaged stock is paid for in full! You agree to pay, however
    a short while after leaving you realise Father Christmas will be expecting a
    reimbursement claim form to be filled out, checking your receipt you realise
    that it only states the items generically, which will not be good enough for
    the expense request. Going to the shop\u2019s website you look through their
    stock to find out what items you had to compensate to work out what they were.
    Annoyingly your card payment was processed in your own currency, which also complicates
    matters!"
