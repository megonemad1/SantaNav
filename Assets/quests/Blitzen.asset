  text: "The naughty elves have abandoned Blitzen at a danish pastry factory in Denmark,
    but not before they completely ransacked all the delicious, baked goods, eating
    everything in sight! The factory owner is livid and ranting that his biggest
    Christmas order is ruined and that he will lose his biggest contract to date.
    Turning to you and Blitzen the factory owner insists that you make things right
    otherwise he threatens to take Blitzen to the glue factory next door! His famous
    recipe has been torn to shreds so your only option is to use Blitzen\u2019s family
    recipe to make the pastries."
