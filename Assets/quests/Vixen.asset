  text: "Cleaning & Stacking Dishes Touching down in Greenland you check Santa Nav,
    which points to a Michelin Star restaurant. \u201Cthis can't be good\u201D you
    think to yourself. You head to the restaurant, stepping inside you flag down
    a waiter to ask if they have seen a reindeer nearby (hoping immensely that no
    mischief has taken place in this very expensive establishment).  The waiter's
    expression soon turns angry and he ushers you to a side room where you are curtly
    told to wait for the restaurant manager. The Manager appears with a very stern
    expression and explains that a Reindeer has indeed been on the premises along
    with a group of delinquents who started a food fight jumping on their customers
    tables and smashing plates. The group of yobs managed to scamper before they
    could detain them. The Reindeer however has been put to work in the kitchens
    to make up for all the mess and destruction by cleaning the plates. You offer
    to help to get the job done faster and he leads you through to the pot wash area
    where you can only just make out the antlers of Vixen behind a huge stack of
    dirty plates. Looking up at you Vixen\u2019s demeanour changes from complete
    hopelessness to delight at seeing you. So, you roll up your sleeves and get stuck
    in! Stack the plates from the first station to the last. You can only put smaller
    plates on top of bigger ones, so as not to break them! Once all the plates are
    moved to the last station you will get the secret code to convince the chef to
    let you and Vixen leave. "
