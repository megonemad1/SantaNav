  text: "Arriving in Sydney you discover Prancer has been shackled to the roof of
    the Sydney Opera House. \u201COh dear, this cant be good for his acrophobia!
    \"Many people are standing and watching as rescuers try to climb up to rescue
    him. Joining the climbers, you tell them about the naughty elves and that you
    are helping to recover the missing reindeer. Reaching the top of the building
    you see Prancer is tied up with a thick chain that has been padlocked shut. 
    The only trace the Elves were there, are their muddy footprints left in a trail
    leading to a small trap door, so there is no way of getting the code from them!
    Get the right numbers to unlock the padlock by trying different combinations.
    To check and try your selected number click on the keyhole symbol. You will be
    shown how many in the sequence you have gotten correct. But be carful, too many
    entries will reset the padlock code and you will have to start over...."
